## Homework 3 (with Homework 5 Updates)

This project implements a calculator with basic arithmetic operations and features object-oriented design. It supports automated testing with pytest and uses the Faker library to generate test data.


## Features
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Graceful Error Handling: Handles division by zero and other invalid inputs with meaningful error messages.
- Modular Design: Uses the Command Pattern to allow for easy extension of new commands.
- Interactive REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop): A command-line interface for performing calculations interactively.
- Automated Testing: Uses `pytest` to verify the functionality of the commands.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo.
2. Set up a virtual environment
3. Run tests with `pytest`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- pytest: Used for running the test cases. Install it with `pip` if you haven't already.
